    <h1>Summative Portfolio</h1>

    <h2 id="name">Paul Fazackerley</h2>

    <p>Hello, and welcome to my Summative Portfolio.</p>
    
    <p>I applied for this apprenticeship in summer '18 after seeing a poster on a notice board in my office; I had heard of Makers before, and I have always wanted to get into software development, so my interest was piqued.</p>

    <h3>A little history...</h3>

    <p>For years I had been doing little bits and pieces of code here and there, be it some Visual Basic to automate something in an Excel spreadsheet or Access database, or cloning a website from scratch to hone my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When opportunities arose, I did try to turn my interest into a career but, for one reason or another, it never took off, much to my chagrin; when I saw that poster, I couldn’t not apply.</p>

    <p>I started working for Defra in 2005 after moving to Newcastle from Wigan. I had a couple of admin roles before quickly moving into the IT department. Initially, I was in a system support role, acting as first point of contact for users experiencing issues with the inhouse IT system. This involved working closely with the supplier, Accenture, to identify common issues and implement bug fixes and system improvements.</p>

    <p>After a few years I moved into a data role, handling the transport of customer information between systems. Oftentimes this involved handling financial information, so security was a main consideration, and at the time the government was pushing for services to be ‘digital-by-default’, so there needed to be robustness to our processes to ensure fidelity and provide the public with confidence in digital services.</p>

    <p>After a few more years I moved into the role I was in before applying for this apprenticeship, in asset management. Initially with an emphasis on hardware, tracking laptops and other mobile devices, I later moved into software licensing. Whilst in that role, I worked closely with developers to create a tool for monitoring the use of Wi-Fi.</p>

    <p>In each of these roles, there were pieces of work that touched on software development, and when they did, I would get involved as much as I could, so before the apprenticeship began I had some idea of what being a software developer would be like.</p>

    <h3>...and a bigger future</h3>

    <p>Since securing a place on the apprenticeship, my confidence in coding has grown massively. I thoroughly enjoyed the boot camp with Makers; as well as the support and guidance, the space and time away from day to day life just to concentrate on coding was invaluable.</p>

    <p>When I returned from the boot camp I joined a team working on Environmental Land Management, which I talk about in more detail in my evidence; it is one of Defra’s flagship schemes and over the coming years I should gain a wealth of software development experience and work on a variety of services.</p>

    <p>There are a large number of software development teams across Defra, working in a variety of programming languages, but each working to a shared standard. One of my first priorities on my return was to familiarise myself with the department’s coding standards; there was documentation to review but I found it most useful to review and compare existing projects.</p>

    <p>Having worked for Defra for a number of years, I was already quite familiar with policies around health and safety, and I’ve been mindful throughout the year to maintain a good work-life balance, particular when my work situation changed mid-year, as I have written more about in my evidence.</p>

    <p>When necessary, I have taken time away from coding so as to not burn out, which at times has been quite difficult given that before the apprenticeship I would code for fun, but I believe I have struck a good balance and am in a good position to take on the challenges that come with software development roles.</p>

    <p>Below you will find links to the larger pieces of work I have been involved with in the last 8 months. I have thoroughly enjoyed the work I've done up to this point, and I am very much looking forward to what's to come.</p>
